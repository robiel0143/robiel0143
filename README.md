**About Me**  

# My Journey from Electrical Engineering to Programming

My name is **Robel**, a proud graduate of the **_Eritrean Institute of Technology_**, where I majored in **Electrical and Electronics Engineering**. My passion for programming sparked during my academic journey, especially while working on my senior project, which was closely related to programming. Additionally, I had taken a few introductory courses in programming, which further fueled my curiosity.

After conducting thorough research, I discovered that **Python** was one of the most accessible and highly in-demand programming languages at the time. It was gaining significant popularity, and I decided to start learning it from scratch. However, my journey was far from easy. The onset of the **COVID-19 pandemic** posed unexpected challenges, particularly in my country, where we faced the obstacle of having no internet access.

Despite these hurdles, I persevered. I turned to books as my primary resource, seeking recommendations from others about which references to use. Without formal guidance or internet support, I became entirely **self-taught**, dedicating a full year to becoming proficient in Python.

Through this journey, I realized something profound: programming isn't just about memorizing code. It’s about understanding the **foundations and their real-world applications**, which keeps the learning process engaging and fuels your energy to continue. This realization shaped my approach, and despite the challenges of transitioning from **Electrical Engineering** to programming, I found immense pride in achieving this milestone through self-determination and hard work.
