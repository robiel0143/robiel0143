## About Me

# My Journey from Electrical Engineering to Programming

My name is **Robel**,
 a proud graduate of the **Eritrean Institute of Technology**, where I majored in
 **Electrical and Electronics Engineering**.
  My passion for programming sparked during my academic journey, especially while
  working on
  my senior project
  , which was closely related to programming. Additionally, I had taken a few
  introductory courses in programming, which further fueled my curiosity.

After conducting thorough research, I discovered that **Python** was one of the
most accessible and highly in-demand programming languages at the time.
 It was gaining significant popularity, and I decided to start learning it from scratch.
  However, my journey was far from easy. The onset of the **COVID-19 pandemic**
  posed unexpected challenges, particularly in my country,
   where we faced the obstacle of having no internet access.

Despite these hurdles, I persevered. I turned to books as my primary resource,
 seeking recommendations from others about which references to use.
Without formal guidance or internet support, I became entirely **self-taught**,
dedicating a full year to becoming proficient in Python.

>"Through this journey, I realized something profound: programming isn't just
about memorizing code. It’s about understanding the
 **foundations and their real-world applications**,
  which keeps the learning process engaging and fuels your energy to continue.
  This realization shaped my approach, and despite the challenges of transitioning
  from **Electrical Engineering** to programming, I found immense pride in
  achieving this milestone through self-determination and hard work."

Learning programming under these circumstances taught me the value of
**Resilience and Resourcefulness**, and I am grateful for the
journey that brought me here.
